in Package : in script we can write the commands for the start of the app
babel plugin trasform remove plugin removes console

Render - update something in dom
 Babel is compiler/traspiler
react.create element gives us an object
 
 JSx - react .create element is difficult for complex files
 so to update html with js, jsx came into picture
 JSX is not html in JS
 IT is html like structure or syntax

  let heading = <h1>HEading</h1>  // here heading is an object..This object will be rendered as html in dom
  \
  jsx is understood by babel n not the brwser
  JSX is converted into react.createElement by babel 
  babel comes along with parcel

  nodemodule also has a package.json..it has the the details of trasitive dependencies

  react component is  a normal JS function, which return jsx/react element or another component


  React Element: root.render(heading)
  React component: root.render(<Heading />)

  to use react element in a component
  {heading}
  if it is component n we need to call inside another component
  {Heading()} or <Heading />


  jsx sanitizes tha JS code inside it



  1. What is JSX?
     const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
     It is a syntax extension to JS
     IT is neither a string nor html
